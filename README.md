# Evaluation of DBSCAN Clustering Technique on Time Series Data with Anomalies

## Problem Statement

An implemented monitoring solution that uses Random Cut Forest (RCF) is experiencing high-false discovery rate (approximately 40%). This results in more operational overhead without improving system reliability. This also resulted in alert-desynsitization which further led to critical incidents being missed due to alerts being buried under false-positive narrative.

This projects aims to evaluate a promising tool that uses Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) to increase alerting precision without sacrificing recall.
